You can use your active directory username and password to login
to a PC running Fedora 14. This is how I did it:

Install pam\_krb5
and samba-winbind:\ 

::


  yum install pam_krb5 samba-winbind



Click
‘System’, ‘Administration’, ‘Authentication’. Enter the root
password.

Enter the following settings (adapt ‘MYDOMAIN’,
‘EXAMPLE.COM’, and ‘mydc\ *n*\ ’ to your situation)

-  User Account Database: Winbind
-  Winbind Domain: MYDOMAIN
-  Security Model: ads
-  Winbind ADS Realm: EXAMPLE.COM
-  Winbind Domain Controllers: mydc1, mydc2
-  Template Shell: /bin/bash
-  Check ‘Allow offline login’

Click ‘Join Domain’, and enter username and password of a domain
account.

Under ‘Advanced options’, Password Hashing Algorithm
should be ‘MD5’, and ‘Create home directories on the first login’ should
be checked.

Click Apply, and close the window.

Now you should
be able to logon with username ‘MYDOMAIN\\\\myuser’, and your domain
password. If you don't want the prefix ‘MYDOMAIN\\\\’, edit
``/etc/samba/smb.conf``. In the section ``[global]`` change


::


  winbind use default domain = false


to


::


  winbind use default domain = true


and reboot (or restart winbind
and/or samba).
