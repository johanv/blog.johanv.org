Suppose you want to make a screencast, and upload the video to Youtube.
This doesn't sound to hard to do. But I went through a lot of troubles
before it actually worked. So I decided to write this down, in case
someone else runs into the same problems. I am using Debian
Sid.

There are several packages available for creating a
screencast, and I first tried
`xvidcap <http://xvidcap.sourceforge.net/>`__. But when trying to record
the sound as well, I got the message ‘Error accessing sound input from
/dev/dsp’. I did some Googling, but I couldn't find an easy
workaround.

So for my next attempt, I used
`Istanbul <https://live.gnome.org/Istanbul>`__. This allowed me to
create screencasts with sound, but when uploading the file to Youtube,
Youtube complained about an unrecognized file format. Damn.

Again,
if you Google the problem, you will find `some
tips <http://www.tummy.com/journals/entries/jafo_20110129_184800>`__,
but none of them worked for me.

At last, after some trial and
error, it seems that `openshot <http://www.openshotvideo.com/>`__ can do
the trick. Create a video project with openshot, import the ogg-video
from Istanbul, put the video on the first track, and export the result
again with the predefined web template. This creates a .mov-file, which
youtube will happily show.
