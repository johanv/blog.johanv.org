.. description: Drop the fake arguments for trying out Linux. Use the real ones.
.. type: text

 I've been using Linux since the end of 1999 which is 15 years. I've been trying for almost 15 years to convince to also try Linux. Others And I must confess that I very often wrong arguments have used. Thereby After 15 years it is time to some misunderstandings the world to help, and to tell you why you should use Linux you are the real reasons:-)

I'm not the only Linux with wrong arguments aanprees: it's a common problem.

As an experiment, I asked recently to Google : "Why Linux?". The first result gave me an older looking website, that some of the most common arguments lists.

But of course, Google filters search results neatly based on what he knows of me, so I asked the question also DuckDuckGo . There was the first link to a blog post from 2012, with similar arguments .

Both pages are already quite old. What explains why some arguments are simply outdated. Yet you hear those arguments are very common. And often wrongly. I take a number of under the microscope.

So:
Try not Linux ...
because it's free

Linux is free. That is true. You can download and install on your PC. But that is no argument. Because if you buy a PC, you buy it with an operating system. You've already paid, and it is already installed. That is as good as free.

Buying a PC with no operating system, is not so easy. I think you all need to step, where the price will be higher than what it higher to the specialized supplier - I'm saying something - a PC with Windows that of Aldi coming.
because it is faster

I doubt strongly that a PC anyway going to work if you install Linux on quickly. Today, if you do a default installation of a mainstream distribution (like Linux Mint or Ubuntu ), then you do it best in a recent PC with enough memory and processing power. Just as there are some requirements for Windows 8.

It is true that you can work with Linux. An old PC is still at an acceptable rate But you have enough experience to make when selecting and configuring your distribution. The day And it will probably be at the expense of usability.

So if you do not have the experience, and you have no one to help you if you do not want to lose their usability, a Linux distribution will not work faster than any other OS.
since it is quickly completely installed

Buy yourself a new computer. What does it matter that you can install Linux soon There is already pre-installed a different system. This is always faster than something new to set up.
because open source software is more secure

Since Bleed Heart , Shell Shock and Drupageddon we know that open source software is vulnerable just like other systems. I believe that the chance of error becomes smaller as more people look to the source code. But then there must be people looking at the source code. Especially Shellshock I find impressive: this vulnerability is a documented feature, which is in bash for more than 20 years. During those 20 years, there was simply no one stop to think that this feature could be used unwanted things. Abused

Previously, there was sometimes laughed with the security of Windows. Probably rightly so. But Microsoft has come a long way. I believe that the architecture of Windows 7 is such that you can configure it safe.

But as with Linux, the system is only as secure as you configure it. Windows is often criticized because it is very easy to get as a regular user administrator privileges. But with Ubuntu and derivatives proceeds that really is not much more difficult. And imagine that as a searcher Puppy Linux would install because you're looking for a quick distribution, you log in as root by default. Quod erat demonstrandum.

If you use Linux, you have generally required. Antivirus software Well, if Windows is up to date, your user does not have administrator rights, and you know what you're doing, then you can think today also under Windows virus scanner on. If only because Virus long so good no longer work as they used to , just because the viruses today are smart enough to encrypt itself.
because it is more stable

On the server maybe. All I put my hand there not in the fire. But most of the people you want to persuade you to use Linux are not going to set up a server. At best, they want to try on their laptop. The But if they - I only say something - have an nVidia graphics card, dare stability sometimes be a problem .
because you get free support from a fine community

If you have a question about Linux, then type in Google, which usually takes you to a discussion on Stack Exchange , and you then find the correct answer. Often. Not often. It varies.

But - do not tell anybody - if you have a question about Windows, which works equally well. And I suspect that this is also the case in Android and Apple Land.

And - though I've had in open-source communities many positive experiences - it is certainly not always a bed of roses: it is sometimes very hard to it, as Lennart Poettering aankaart in a post on Google+. Poettering himself is not above reproach, but that can not be an excuse for another to make mistakes.
because you as the great enemy, Microsoft, fights

Not really an argument from the pages that I found through the various search engines, but it is one that I often used in the past. And in that past that was undoubtedly right:-)

But today this is no longer relevant, I think. The days when Microsoft was the only player on the market, are over. I just looked it up which operating systems visitors to the website Chirojeugd Flanders use. Windows' share is only 65%. IOS (iPhone and iPad) accounts for 15%. Macintosh and Android take both 9% of turnover. Windows is not alone, and that they know very well at Microsoft.

In recent years, more and more put Microsoft on interoperability and open source. In the near future you will be able to host ASP.NET Web applications from a Linux Server with Mono . Today there are all MS Office programs Office for Android and IOS . A large number .NET libraries that Microsoft develops (eg. Entity Framework and ASP.NET MVC ), are available under the Apache 2 license. It would not surprise me Windows had to eventually be free, just like Android.

Granted, Microsoft is still a many-headed monster. While one of the heads befriends the open-source community, another leg spans lawsuits over software patents. Jeremy Allison, the founder of the Samba project, knew at FOSDEM 2013 to say that he could work with Microsft for the development of Samba 4 very good On the other hand, he was very happy that he once could come to Brussels for the occasion for FOSDEM, because usually he had to Brussels for lawsuits.

But nevertheless, I think there's been a change at Microsoft. I hear more positive stories than before, they are no longer the enemy to fight. That time has passed.

The companies that you should keep in mind that today are Apple and Google. From that angle I hear more disturbing stories than on the part of Microsoft. But I dedicate another time ever on the matter.
because you have everything with Thunderbird and LibreOffice what is needed

I hear this too often. "All the necessary software is available, for example, Thunderbird and LibreOffice."

Seriously? Office and mail? Is that what you need? In 2000 perhaps, but today? I think not.

Office is just the thing is that you do not need . If you do your work in Office, or in your mail client, then I think you're doing wrong. What do you think do need is a browser, a document reader and a decent text editor. And if it is really necessary, even a spreadsheet. There you come a long way these days.

Do not put the emphasis on LibreOffice. If you're talking about LibreOffice, people are going to compare with Microsoft Office. And then Microsoft Office still has some 'slicker'. But that's really not relevant, because an office application you do not need today. If you necessarily want to do something like use Google docs. But I think there will always be better solutions.
Why?

Are there actually still reasons to use Linux? Naturally. Otherwise I would not do it myself. Here, everyone is waiting for: the real reasons why everyone should be a fan of Linux.
A wide range easy to install software

If you're a mainstream Linux distribution are installed, you have access to a very wide range of software packages, via the so-called software repository. You can compare this with an app store. Do you want to install an application to edit photos or audio you need for any programming language a programming environment: it is for your downloaded and installed.

Now you have nowadays many app stores. But I have the impression that the quality of the applications in Linux software repositories is generally higher than the quality of, for example Google Play applications. And applications in the repository contain significantly fewer ads.
No crapware

I have just not said you operating system inherits virtually free if you buy a computer? What I forgot to say there is that you often have one in the case of Windows or Android whole bunch of other software inherits, that you really do not need. (On a Mac you have that maybe less, but that's also less "quasi free ':))

You know the drill, those programs that do everything, or just did not, and who are beginning to complain that you have to purchase a license. After X time Maybe the software also provides information about you to any third party, it's hard to say. And removing the software is not always easy, because it is often unclear what is now required to use your PC and what not.

An open source Linux distribution is almost never preinstalled. So you have to go through a tedious installation procedure. But what you have then is a clean system with no crap . That alone makes the inconvenience of installing more than good.
Easy reinstallation

If for any reason must be completely re-install a PC, Linux is the easiest solution. You download an image, and you can get started without that you need a license.
Free software rules

The main reason I kept until recently, of course: Linux is free software. And the vast majority of the applications that come with a Linux distribution is too. When you install free software, then you, by definition, have access to the source code of the software. This means that you can check whether that software does not do things you do not like it. Or, if you do not like studying source code, which can be done by an independent party.

If you use software that you do not have access to the source code, you have to trust your supplier. Does the software nothing behind your back ? Put your software a backdoor into your computer open so body X or Y can check if you're good enough ? Can that body also turn off your computer for example, remotely? And to what extent are the backdoors then secured against persons with malicious intent?

Obviously I did not read the source code of all the software I use. I do not (more;) compile) all my software itself, to be sure that the software I was indeed created from the data source. But the fact that I know it can, still gives me a kind of peace of mind.

Nowadays, more and more devices can be connected to the Internet. Phones, watches, home automation, cars ... I would not appreciate my car doors had to be because there is a backdoor in the software is opened.

The only guarantee to monitor the comings and goings of your devices is open source software. Such control, we can not pass up . About Software in our car I unfortunately nothing to say. But on my PC later. And I'd like to keep as long as possible.
Work in progress

I feel that there is still some work to be done my good and bad arguments. But on any given day you have to put a text online. I'm curious what you think of it. Do you have comments, feel free to post them in the discussion thread below. Or, if you prefer not to work with that evil Disqus system (not unjustly actually), feel free to send a pull request .
