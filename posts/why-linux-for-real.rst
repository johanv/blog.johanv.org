.. description: Drop the fake arguments for trying out Linux. Use the real ones.
.. type: text

I am a Linux user since the end of 1999. Which is 15 years already. I've
also been trying for almost 15 years to convince other people to try Linux.
And I must confess that I very often used wrong arguments to do this.
After 15 years it is time to ditch some fake arguments,
and to tell you the real reasons why you should use Linux. :-)

I'm not the only one that tried to convice people to use Linux based on fake
arguments aanprees: it's a common problem.

As an experiment, I recentlky asked Google: "Waarom Linux?". ('Why Linux?')
I asked the question in Dutch, because that's what my friends would
typically do. If they were interested at all.

The first result was a website that looked as it had been around for a
long time. It listed some of the commonly heard arguments.

But of course, Google filters its search results based on what it knows
of me, so I also asked DuckDuckGo as well. The first result over there
was a blog post from 2012, with similar arguments .

Both pages were already quite old. What explains why some arguments
were outdated. Yet you still hear those arguments very often. And often
they are wrong. I take a look at the common ones:

So:

Do not try Linux...
===================

because you don't have to pay for it
------------------------------------

You don't have to pay money for downloading or using Linux. That
is a fact. But that is
no argument. When you buy a PC, you get an operating system as well.
You paid for the operating system that came with your PC. At that time,
installing Linux doesn't save you money any more.

You could buy a PC without an operating system, could you?
It's not that easy. If you want that, I think you'll have to go to
a specialized supplier. Where prices might be higher than at the
local discounter, where they offer PC's with Windows at low prices
once and again.

because Linux is faster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I strongly doubt that a PC will work faster after installing Linux.
If you install a mainstream distribution (like Linux Mint or Ubuntu) with
the default settings today, then your pc better had enough memory and
processing power. Modern Linux distributions have 'modern' requirements,
just like this is the case with other operating systems.

It is true that you can make old PCs useable again with Linux. But only
if you have enough experience to select and configure a distribution.
If your distribution is fast and has a small memory footprint, this will
probably be at the expense of usability.

because you can install it quickly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Buy yourself a new computer. What does it matter that you can install
Linux quickly? There is already an operating system pre-installed. This is
always faster than setting up something new. 

because open source software is more secure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since Heartbleed, Shellshock and Drupageddon we know that open source
software is vulnerable just like any other kind of software. I do believe
that the chance on errors in the source code becomes smaller as more
people look at it. But the source code being availabe, doesn't guarantee
that peple are actually looking.

I found Shellshock very impressive: this vulnerability has been
a documented feature in bash for more than 20 years. During those 20
years, simply no one noticed that this feature could be used for unwanted
things. Abused

I often have made fun of Windows' security. And I was probably right at
the time :). But Microsoft has come a long way. I believe that the
architecture of Windows 7 is such that you can configure it in a
secure way.

But as with Linux, a system is only as secure as you configure it. Windows
is often criticized because it is very easy to get as a regular user
administrator privileges. But with Ubuntu and derivatives, the process
really isn't a lot more difficult. And imagine that as you install Puppy
Linux because you're looking for a quick distribution, you log in as
root by default.

If you use Linux, you generally don't need Antivirus software. Well,
if you keep your Windows OS up to date, if your default user does not
have administrator permissions, and if you know what you're doing, then
I think you can nowadays also run Windows without antivirus software.
Antivirus software doesn't work as good as it used to eather, because
a lot of viruses today are smart enough to encrypt themselves.

because it is more stable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the server, maybe. But most of the people you want to persuade you
to use Linux are not going to set up a server. At best, they want to
try it out on their laptop. But if they - just to say something -
have an nVidia graphics card, I dare say that stability might be a problem.

because you get free support from a fine community
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have a question about Linux, just ask Google. Google usually
takes you to a discussion on Stack Exchange, and then you find the
correct answer. Chances are you do. Chances are you don't. It depends.

But - do not tell anybody - if you have a question about Windows, this
probably works as well. And I suspect that this is also the case for
Android and Apple-OSes.

And although I've had many positive experiences in open source
communities, it is certainly not always a bed of roses. Sometimes
people can be very brutal, as Lennart Poettering says in a rant on
Google+. I won't pretend that Poettering always behaves exemplary, but
even if he didn't, this cannot be an excucse for others to behave badly.

because you need to fight Microsoft, the great enemy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not really an argument from the pages that I found through the various
search engines, but it is one that I often used in the past. And in that
past that was undoubtedly right:-)

But today this is no longer relevant, I think. The days when Microsoft
was the only player on the market, are over. I just had a look on the
analytics page for chiro.be, the non-profit organization I work for.
Windows' share is only 65%. IOS (iPhone and iPad) accounts for
15%. Macintosh and Android take both 9%. Windows is not alone,
and Microsoft knows this very well.

In recent years, Microsoft invests more and more in interoperability
and open source. In the near future you will be able to host ASP.NET
web applications on a Linux Server with Mono. Today there are MS Office
programs for Android and IOS. A fair amount of .NET libraries 
developed by Microsoft (like Entity Framework and ASP.NET MVC), are 
available under the Apache 2 license. It would not surprise me if Windows
will eventually given away free as in beer, just like Android.

Granted, Microsoft is still a monster with multiple heads. While one of the
heads is friendly towards the open-source community, another head
is sueing projects over software patents. Jeremy Allison, the founder of
the Samba project, told at FOSDEM 2013 to that he worked together with
Microsft on Samba 4. On the other hand, he was very happy that he could
come to Brussels for once to speak at FOSDEM, instead of having to deal
with judges.

Nevertheless, I think Microsoft is changing slowly. I hear more positive
stories than before. Microsoft is no longer the enemy to fight. That time
has passed.

The companies that you should keep an eye on today, are Apple and
Google. I hear more disturbing stories about those two than about
Microsoft. I might tell you more about this another time.

because you have everything: Thunderbird and LibreOffice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I hear this too often. "All the necessary software is available, for
example, Thunderbird and LibreOffice."

Seriously? Office and mail? Is that what you need? In 2000 perhaps,
but today? I think not.

Office is just the thing is that you do not need. If you do your work
in Office, or in your mail client, then I think you're doing it wrong. What
you need is a browser, a document reader and a decent text
editor. And if really necessary, maybe a spreadsheet. If you've got
this, you're ready to go.

Do not put any emphasis on LibreOffice. If you're talking about
LibreOffice, people will compare it to Microsoft Office. And
Microsoft Office is more streamlined, like it or not. 

But that's not relevant,
because you don't neet an office suite today. If you necessarily
want to do something like Microsoft Office, use Google docs. 
But I think there will always be better solutions.

Should I still use Linux?
-------------------------

So are there still valid reasons to use Linux? Of course. Otherwise I
would not use it myself. So here is what everyone has been waiting for:
the real reasons why everyone should be a fan of Linux.

A wide range of easy to install software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you install a mainstream Linux distribution, you have
access to a very wide range of software packages, via the so-called
software repository. You can compare this with an app store. You
want to install an application to edit photos or audio? You need
a programming environment for any programming language? You can
download and install all this automatically.

Today, there are many app stores around. But I have the impression
that the quality of the applications in Linux software repositories
is generally higher than the quality of, for example apps in Google
Play. And applications in a repository certainly contain significantly
less ads.

No crapware
~~~~~~~~~~~

Did I tell you that your operating system is installed as good as for
free when you buy a new computer? What I forgot to tell, is that very
often a lot of other software is installed for free as well. A lot of
software you actually don't want or need.  (Maybe this is less the case
for Apple products, but they are also less 'as good as free'. :))

I bet you've seen them before: those programs that do who-knows-what,
and start to complain after a certain amout of time that you have to
purchase a license. Maybe this software also provides information about
you to some third party, it's hard to say. And removing it is not always
easy, because it is often unclear what exactly is required to use your
PC and what isn't.

An open source Linux distribution is almost never preinstalled. So you
have to go through a tedious installation procedure. But after that,
you have this clean system without crappy software. That alone makes up
for the inconvenience of installing.

Easy reinstallation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If for any reason must be completely re-install a PC, Linux is the easiest
solution. You download an image, and you get started without 
having to search for a license key or something.

Free software rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the number one reason to try Linux: Linux is free software.
And the vast majority of the applications that come with a Linux
distribution, is free software too. When you install free software, then
by definition you have access to the source code of the software. This
means that you can check whether that software doesn't do things you do
not want. Or, if you do not like studying source code, you can let an
independent party check it out.

If you use software that you do not have access to the source code, you have to trust your supplier. Does the software nothing behind your back ? Put your software a backdoor into your computer open so body X or Y can check if you're good enough ? Can that body also turn off your computer for example, remotely? And to what extent are the backdoors then secured against persons with malicious intent?

Obviously I did not read the source code of all the software I use. I do not (more;) compile) all my software itself, to be sure that the software I was indeed created from the data source. But the fact that I know it can, still gives me a kind of peace of mind.

Nowadays, more and more devices can be connected to the Internet. Phones, watches, home automation, cars ... I would not appreciate my car doors had to be because there is a backdoor in the software is opened.

The only guarantee to monitor the comings and goings of your devices is open source software. Such control, we can not pass up . About Software in our car I unfortunately nothing to say. But on my PC later. And I'd like to keep as long as possible.
Work in progress

I feel that there is still some work to be done my good and bad arguments. But on any given day you have to put a text online. I'm curious what you think of it. Do you have comments, feel free to post them in the discussion thread below. Or, if you prefer not to work with that evil Disqus system (not unjustly actually), feel free to send a pull request .
