After moving my Drupal 6 websites to another hosting provider, I got an
error message every time I have to update a module. It
says:

\ ``\nAn unrecoverable error has occurred. You can find the error message below. It is advised to copy it to the clipboard for reference.\nPlease continue to the error page\nAn HTTP error 0 occurred. http://johanv.org/update.php?id=18&op=do\n``

The
problem has probably to do with Drupal issue
`1046682 <http://drupal.org/node/1046682>`__, but I don't understand how
I can fix it.

But after a whole lot of Googling, I found a stupid
workaround for this problem. You can run the update script using
Internet Explorer. The problem only shows up with Firefox and Chromium.
What a fail.
