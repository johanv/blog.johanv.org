A week or two ago, I disabled the registration of new users on
this site: only spammers seemed to be interested in getting an account
on my blog.

Nevertheless, if you want to comment on what I write, I
think you should have the opportunity to do so. So I decided to post
every article I write on identi.ca, and link to the corresponding
discussion, so that everyone with an identi.ca account can comment on my
texts. This way I don't have to do user management, and checking for
f\*\*\*ng spammers.

So far so good. But last week, identi.ca got
upgraded to version 1.0 of StatusNet. Which has tons of new features,
but which also 'flattens' the discussion threads. If you go to the page
of a discussion, you don't get the tree of messages StatusNet 9.9
generated, you just get the stream of messages in chronological
order.

Some people like this, some don't, but this was not what I
want as a feedback system for my site. So I quickly programmed something
in php, that reconstructs the discussion tree of any identi.ca
discussion. Like for example
http://test.johanv.org/StatusThread/?controller=conversation&id=84176717

As
you can probably see, it is pretty basic. I will probably improve it,
but as I am famous of my failed projects, I won't promise anything :-)
But it is open source, that's something. You can find the code on
https://github.com/johanv/StatusThread/.

\ **UPDATE:** In the
identi.ca settings, you can now re-enable the conversation trees:
