My favourite mail client is
mutt. At work we have an Exchange mail server, and I wanted to use mutt
for my work e-mail. Today it works. (I am using Fedora 19 beta)

Our
mail server supports IMAP access, so reading mail is easy. But the
difficult part, is sending e-mails.

In a first attempt, I tried
this in the mutt
configuration:\ ``\nset smtp_url="smtp://mylogin@our.local.mailserver:587"\nset smtp_pass="mySecretPassword"\n``

I
think this has worked for me somewhere in the past, but now I get the
error message 'No authenticators available.' So I had to try something
else.

Now I am using msmtp to send my e-mails. I installed it from
the repositories:\ ``\nyum install mstmtp``

I created a
configuration file:
``~/.msmtprc``:``\naccount myaccount\nhost webmail.our.domain\nfrom my.email@our.domain\nauth ntlm\ntls on\ntls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt\nuser mylogin\nntlmdomain MYDOMAIN\npassword "mySecretPassword"\nport 587\naccount default : myaccount\n``

In
the mutt configuration, I removed the smtp-setttings, and added
``\nset sendmail="/usr/bin/msmtp"\n``

And guess what. It just
worked (TM) :-)
