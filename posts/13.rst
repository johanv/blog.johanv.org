Enabling multiple user accounts for the
`Linpus <http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=linpus>`__
distribution on my `Acer Aspire One <http://www.acer.com/aspireone>`__
was not trivial. After booting, the user 'user' is logged on
automatically, and this user was the only one which could use sound and
the links to documents, music,... This is why I wrote a quick
howto.

\ **Before you start:** Make sure you have a bootable
usb-stick handy, in case your system refuses to boot after changing a
file. I used Debian Lenny beta 2, with an updated kernel.

To
display an xterm, press Alt+f2, and enter 'xterm'. You can enable the
right-click menu launching 'xfce-setting-show' from the command line,
and unchecking 'show desktop menu on right click' under desktop
behaviour. (Click the left arrow on your task bar if it is hiding the
'Close' button of the settings dialog.)

Edit /etc/inittab: replace
the
line
\ ``\n#1:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty --autologin user tty1\n``
by
\ ``\n1:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty1\n``
And
decomment
\ ``\nx:5:respawn:/etc/X11/prefdm -nodaemon\n``

(I
commented out the lines for virtual consoles 2-6 as well, but
ctrl+alt+f\ *x* seems disabled somehow.)

In '/etc/rc.d/rc.S',
comment out the
line
\ ``\n#   /usr/bin/xinit -- -br>/dev/null 2>&1 &\n``

That
should do it.
