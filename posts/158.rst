Just a quick howto about installing a Citrix client on Fedora, because I
didn't find a clear explanation using Google.

The tricy part about
installing ‘Citrix Receiver’ on Fedora, is that you need openmotif. In
order to install openmotif, you have to enable the rpmfusion software
repository. (See http://rpmfusion.org/Configuration)

Then you
install opnemotif:
\ ``\nyum install openmotif\n``

Finally, you
download and install the i386-rpm of the citrix receiver from this page:
