In this paper we present an alternative approach to remove restrictions
on the domain of interval
functions and to guarantee the inclusion
property in all situations, even when some input intervals
contain
points that lie outside the domain of the underlying point function. To
achieve this, we allow
for the (efficient) set-based representation of
non-real results. The computed intervals are sharp, yet
contain more
information and the resulting interval system is closed and
exception-free. We also
show how the presented ideas can be
implemented in an interval arithmetic library. The
performance
overhead is negligible compared to the fact that the
implementation using the new approach offers
100% reliability in
return.
