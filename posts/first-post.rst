At last I migrated my blog. It used to be a Drupal 6 blog, and I wasn't
sure whether I wanted to migrate to Drupal 7 or Drupal 8. And eventually,
I didn't migrate to either of those.

Now I am using `Nikola <http://getnikola.com>`_, a static site generator.
I got the idea from `guitarman <http://stevebaer.com>`_, who did an 
`HPR episode about Nikola <http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=1577>`_.

I see a lot of great features:

* I can store my content in a `git <http://git-scm.com>`_ repository.
* I can use my `favourite text editor <http://www.vim.org>`_ to edit my
  blog posts.
* I can save blog posts when I'm not connected to the internet.
* I don't need to install security updates for Drupal and Drupal modules.

Don't get me wrong, I think Drupal is a great product, especially when
content on a website has to be provided by people who don't like to
use git. Or when you need to have some forms on your site. Or when the
server has to do some intelligent work. But my personal blog has other
use cases, like displaying the texts I wrote. So I think a compiled site
might not be such a bad solution.

This site uses `Disqus <http://disqus.com>`_ for managing comments,
which is of course evil. But hey, if you don't want to use Disqus, just
send me a `pull request <https://github.com/johanv/blog.johanv.org>`_
with your comment :-D

I more or less migrated all articles of my drupal site to this new
instance. (I will provide more details on that in :doc:`a later post <drupal-nikola>`.)
But `there is still work to do <https://github.com/johanv/blog.johanv.org/issues>`_, 
as you might already found out.

This is work in progress. I will keep you informed on the progress.
