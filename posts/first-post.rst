At last I migrated my blog. It used to be a Drupal 6 blog, and I wasn't
sure whether I wanted to migrate to Drupal 7 or Drupal 8. And eventually,
I didn't migrate to either of those.

Now I am using `Nikola <http://getnikola.com>`_, a static site generator.
I got the idea from `guitarman <http://stevebaer.com>`_, who did an 
`HPR episode about Nikola <http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=1577>`_.

I see a lot of great features:

* I can store my content in a git repository.
* I can use my `favourite text editor <http://www.vim.org>`_ to edit my
  blog posts.
* I can save blog posts when I'm not connected to the internet.
* I don't need to install Drupal updates.

Don't get me wrong, I think Drupal is a great product, especially when
content on a website has to be provided by people who don't like to
use git. Or when you need to have some forms on your site. But for my
personal blog, I think a compiled site is a better solution.

The commenting system uses `Disqus <http://disqus.com>`_, which is of 
course evil. But hey, if you don't want to use Disqus, just send me
a `pull request <https://github.com/johanv/blog.johanv.org>`_ with
your comment :-D

I more or less migrated all articles of my drupal site to this new
instance. (I will provide more details on that in a later post.)
But it still needs some work, as you can probably see. Also the theme
is not the most beautiful out there, I just applied some hacks on an
existing default theme.

This is work in progress. I will keep you informed on the progress.
