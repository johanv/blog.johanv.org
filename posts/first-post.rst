.. description: First post on my new blog.
.. type: text

Today I listened to `guitarman's HPR episode
<http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=1577>`_ covering the Nikola
static site generator. So now I consider migrating my blog to Nikola
instead of to Drupal 7. I only see advantages:

* I can use git for my content.
* I don't need to install updates, because everything is static.
* I practically don't use any of the Drupal features on my blog anyway.

I think I will migrate the top articles from my old site to the new blog.
And the rest will be archived, and moved out of the way.
