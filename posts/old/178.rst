I was experiencing some problems with my dual screen setup on my Dell
Precision M4500 notebook with Fedora 15. Now that I finally have it up
and running, I thought I might share my configuration as
well.

\ **Update:** You have to enable the
`rpmfusion <http://rpmfusion.org/>`__ repositories.

When using the
'free as in freedom' nouveau driver, I experienced a lot of system
hangs. I guess this is due to `Fedora bug
618143 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=618143>`__. So I
installed the freedom hating NVidia driver as
follows:\ 

::


  su -c "yum install akmod-nvidia xorg-x11-drv-nvidia"
  

I
think I have to install *akmod-nvidia* instead of *kmod-nvidia* because
F15 is still in beta, but I am not sure about that.

**Update:** The following doesn't apply anymore for recent versions of
Fedora. If you have troubles with your display configuration, I recommend
trying `arandr <http://christian.amsuess.com/tools/arandr/>`_. It allows
saving your configuration as a shell script, which is cool.

The
*nvidia-settings* tool seems very buggy, and I didn't manage to generate
a *xorg.conf* file. Luckily I had an old file, which worked fine. I put
the following in
``/etc/X11/xorg.conf``:

(My
external screen is placed at the left of my laptop. If your
configuration is different, I guess you'l have to do some tweaking.)
