My favourite mail client is
mutt. At work we have an Exchange mail server, and I wanted to use mutt
for my work e-mail. Today it works. (I am using Fedora 19 beta)

Our
mail server supports IMAP access, so reading mail is easy. But the
difficult part, is sending e-mails.

In a first attempt, I tried
this in the mutt
configuration:\ 

::


  set smtp_url="smtp://mylogin@our.local.mailserver:587"
  set smtp_pass="mySecretPassword"
  



I
think this has worked for me somewhere in the past, but now I get the
error message 'No authenticators available.' So I had to try something
else.

Now I am using msmtp to send my e-mails. I installed it from
the repositories:\ 

::


  yum install mstmtp



I created a
configuration file:
``~/.msmtprc``:

::


  account myaccount
  host webmail.our.domain
  from my.email@our.domain
  auth ntlm
  tls on
  tls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt
  user mylogin
  ntlmdomain MYDOMAIN
  password "mySecretPassword"
  port 587
  account default : myaccount
  



In
the mutt configuration, I removed the smtp-setttings, and added


::


  set sendmail="/usr/bin/msmtp"
  



And guess what. It just
worked (TM) :-)
