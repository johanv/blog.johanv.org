After moving my Drupal 6 websites to another hosting provider, I got an
error message every time I have to update a module. It
says:

\ 

::


  An unrecoverable error has occurred. You can find the error message below. It is advised to copy it to the clipboard for reference.
  Please continue to the error page
  An HTTP error 0 occurred. http://johanv.org/update.php?id=18&op=do
  



The
problem has probably to do with Drupal issue
`1046682 <http://drupal.org/node/1046682>`__, but I don't understand how
I can fix it.

But after a whole lot of Googling, I found a stupid
workaround for this problem. You can run the update script using
Internet Explorer. The problem only shows up with Firefox and Chromium.
What a fail.
