I value your privacy :-)

But I also like to know which pages on my blog are popular, without having
to set up and maintain some kind of software. That's why I use
[Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/).

I agreed to the 'Google Analytics Data Processing Terms'. Of course I did
not read those terms, but I suspect that I had to agree to be compliant
with the GDPR. At least, that's what
[the Internet](https://reinder.eu/blog/nieuws/google-analytics-avg-gdpr)
told me.

I configured my analytics account so that no data is being collected for
advertizing. Your IP address will be anonymized before it is sent to
Google. And I will not use your data for advertizing purposes myself.

Because of the Google Analytics, my website will store two cookies on
your system.

I use [Disqus](https://disqus.com) to manage comments on my post. You are
not obliged to use Disqus, but if you do, you might read
[Disqus's privacy statement](https://help.disqus.com/terms-and-policies/disqus-privacy-policy)
, if you want.

If you want to provide comments to my posts without having to use Disqus,
you can just [send me an e-mail](/pages/contact/).
