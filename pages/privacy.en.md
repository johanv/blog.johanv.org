I value your privacy :-)

I use [Disqus](https://disqus.com) to manage comments on my post. You are
not obliged to use Disqus, but if you do, you might read
[Disqus's privacy statement](https://help.disqus.com/terms-and-policies/disqus-privacy-policy)
, if you want.

If you want to provide comments to my posts without having to use Disqus,
you can just [send me an e-mail](/pages/contact/).
